## Overview
### Description
This app aims to connect people with local businesses and experiences. With the map feature, users can search for unique places to try while on a trip, or small businesses to shop at home, and filter based on interests/type of business. With guides, people can explore other users' recommendations. Users can also create their own guides and add friends on the app using their profile page.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** social/travel
- **Mobile:** Having the app on your phone makes finding new places on the go easier, using location and maps functionality. Push notifications can remind you about places you were interested in.
- **Story:** Allows users to discover local spots and small businesses, and plan adventures with friends.
- **Market:** People that are traveling to a new place and want to explore that city, as well as people who care about shopping locally rather than buying from big chains can use this app.
- **Habit:** Push notifications reminding users of what they’ve searched for (like Amazon) can build habit by bringing people back to the app. Friend features can also build habits if people can see what their friends are interested in.
- **Scope:** The scope of the app will begin with the essential features - being able to look at and filter a map to find local spots, being able to explore guides to a location (such as best coffee shops in the area), and user profiles people can customize with their interests.
